    "    doc.append(NoEscape(r'Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that has been used to train agents in continuous action space environments, including video games. It is a policy gradient method that is designed to be simple to implement and computationally efficient. Being a on-policy method, the algorithm learns a policy to make decisions in the environment. This is different from an off-policy method, which learns the value of the optimal policy independently of the agent\\'s action. In this project, we reimplemented PPO and used it to train an agent to play and complete levels in Sonic the Hedgehog^\\(TM\\). On a high level, PPO works by choosing an action for the agent to take, then observing the resultant state and reward. Then, an estimate for the advantage gain is computed \\(see GAE\\), which basically measures how much better the action was compared to the average action at that state. The policy is then updated using a special objective function to prevent the policy from updating too mcuh on a single episode by penalizing if the new policy deviates too much from the original policy, ensuring stability. These steps repeat until training is complete. Here is an example of a citation\\footnote{This is a reference}. Here is another reference\\footnote{This is another reference}. This is how I would cite the first reference again^\\(1\\).'))\n",
